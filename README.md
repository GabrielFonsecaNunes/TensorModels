# DeepModels: Easy-to-Use Deep Learning Models for Time Series Analysis

**DeepModels** is a Python library that provides simple and intuitive access to advanced deep learning architectures, such as:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**
- **Transformer Models**
- **Recorrent Neural Network RNN**

Designed for **time series forecasting and modeling**, DeepModels offers a **user-friendly interface** inspired by the **statsmodels** library. With straightforward methods for **fitting**, **predicting**, and **evaluating models**, it simplifies the application of deep learning techniques, making it accessible to both beginners and professionals.

## **Installation**

You can install the library via pip (once it's available on PyPI):

```bash
pip install deepmodels
